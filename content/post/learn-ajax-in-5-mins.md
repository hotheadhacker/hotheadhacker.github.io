Yes you heard it right! You can learn AJAX in 5 mins provided you have little concepts of javaScript and jQuery.

The method I am sharing with you right now will probably boot your AJAX skills.
<!--more-->
**Just for the record:**

**AJAX**  is a developerâ€™s dream, because you can:

-   Update a web page without reloading the page
-   Request data from a server â€“ after the page has loaded
-   Receive data from a server â€“ after the page has loaded
-   Send data to a server â€“ in the background

So without wasting your much more time letâ€™s get our hands dirty with some AJAX ðŸ™‚

Things You need:

1.  **MAIN PAGE**  â€“ A page from where you will send request to another page without reloading current one or navigating to other page  
    
2.  **SOURCE**  **PAGE**  â€“ Itâ€™s generally written in server side scripting language eg. PHP

Now We are done, the key part is server side scripting language needs fully executed just like loading new web page but it doesnâ€™t look dynamic so AJAX comes into play.

## JUST FOCUS FOLLOWING 2 PARTS TO GET ENOUGH ABOUT AJAX.

1.  parentpage.html

source.php

Donâ€™t worry the source code of these two files are available  **[HERE](https://web.archive.org/web/20200814102848/https://github.com/hotheadhacker/simpleAJAXdemo)**  on my github repository!
